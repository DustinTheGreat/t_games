This is the code of conduct for the t_games project. It applies to all work and discussion on the t_games project, including the code, anything on GitHub, the mailing list, any t_games focused meetings, anything where you are representing yourself as part of the t_games team, and any other t_games related communications.

This document may change in the future, especially if the project grows to the point where it is not reasonable to have one person in charge of enforcement.

The first person in this document refers to Craig "Ichabod" O'Brien.

## Don't Be a Jerk

Really. That's what it boils down to. That is the spirit this document tries to clarify, and I hope we can work together in that spirit.

If it's not true or if it doesn't help the project, does it need to be said? If it is true and it will help the project, how should it be said?

## Expected Behavior

* Welcoming and inclusion.
* Respect of others and their view points.
* Calm and rational discussion of issues.
* Graceful acceptance of constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what will help the project, the team, and the users.
* Showing empathy for others.

## Unacceptable Behavior

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, ad hominem arguments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment or threats.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Bigotry, including bigotry based on race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nationality/citizenship, age, child birth, or other tribalism.
* Escalation or retaliation. `wrong + wrong != right`
* Interrupting people.
* Correcting grammar outside of code, output, and documentation.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
