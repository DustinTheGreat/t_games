== Gipf Planning ==

Gambling would make for a good crossover category. connect four <-> roulette, craps <-> solitaire dice, slap jack <-> blackjack, slot machines <-> number guessing game. solitaire_dice <-> solitaire.

Don't depend on gambling. Allow for links across other categores where they make sense.

freecell       -> penguin        (move any card to an empty foundation, turn on wrap_ranks)
klondike       -> solitaire dice (place one card from the stock at the end of the stock)
penguin        -> klondike       (move any one card)
pig            -> solitaire dice (pick one of two rolls)
solitaire dice -> freecell       (free ride)
